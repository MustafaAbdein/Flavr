Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 19 dollars.",

Pulse several times to mix thoroughly.Add the butter, and pulse several times until the butter is thoroughly incorporated and the texture resembles that of a coarse meal---you want the butter pieces to be in varying sizes, some small and others slightly larger. This will result in the flakiest crust.While pulsing, slowly add the water and continue to pulse until the dough just begins to clump together loosely.Remove the dough to a clean counter top, shape together with your hands into a square disc, and cover tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for 1 1/2 - 2 hours, or until firm (dough can be prepared up to three days in advance).Prepare Hand Pies:Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.In a bowl, combine the blueberries, lemon zest, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt. Mix thoroughly. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Set aside with a pastry brush.Remove the pie dough from the fridge, and allow it to rest at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. Once it has rested, place the dough on a lightly floured counter top. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12\" x 15\" rectangle (don't worry if the edges are not perfectly straight). Using a pastry cutter or knife, cut the dough into six rectangles.Brush the edges of the pie dough rectangles with water. Distribute the blueberries evenly into the center of each rectangle, and fold the dough over. Use a fork to seal the edges.Place the hand pies onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the the tops of the pies evenly with egg wash, and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Using a sharp knife, cut two to three small slits into the top of the pies (to allow steam to escape during baking).Bake at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes (rotating halfway), or until the golden brown. Do not worry if some of the filling spills during baking, this is to be expected.Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.",
