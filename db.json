Pulse several times to mix thoroughly.Add the butter, and pulse several times until the butter is thoroughly incorporated and the texture resembles that of a coarse meal---you want the butter pieces to be in varying sizes, some small and others slightly larger. This will result in the flakiest crust.While pulsing, slowly add the water and continue to pulse until the dough just begins to clump together loosely.Remove the dough to a clean counter top, shape together with your hands into a square disc, and cover tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for 1 1/2 - 2 hours, or until firm (dough can be prepared up to three days in advance).Prepare Hand Pies:Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.In a bowl, combine the blueberries, lemon zest, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt. Mix thoroughly. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Set aside with a pastry brush.Remove the pie dough from the fridge, and allow it to rest at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. Once it has rested, place the dough on a lightly floured counter top. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12\" x 15\" rectangle (don't worry if the edges are not perfectly straight). Using a pastry cutter or knife, cut the dough into six rectangles.Brush the edges of the pie dough rectangles with water. Distribute the blueberries evenly into the center of each rectangle, and fold the dough over. Use a fork to seal the edges.Place the hand pies onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the the tops of the pies evenly with egg wash, and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Using a sharp knife, cut two to three small slits into the top of the pies (to allow steam to escape during baking).Bake at 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes (rotating halfway), or until the golden brown. Do not worry if some of the filling spills during baking, this is to be expected.Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Prepare Pie Dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a large food processor.

In a large bowl, beat the shortening and sugar with a standing or handheld electric mixer until fluffy. Add the molasses and beat until well blended. In another large bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger. Add one-third of the flour mixture to the molasses mixture and blend on the lowest speed. Add another third and blend in, then add the final third and blend in. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and leave on the counter overnight. (Letting the dough stand overnight allows the moisture to be evenly spread, which in turn ensures there are no wet spots that stick to the rolling pin or work surface and also that there are no dry spots that tear. This is vital for a dough that is rolled so thin.)2. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).3. Take a handful of dough and shape it into an 8-inch disc, about 1 inch high, as you might do in making a pie crust, on a lightly floured work surface. (Bonnie uses a large flour sack that is well floured as a surface to roll out the dough. I think a floured pastry cloth will work perfectly.) Keep the rest of the dough tightly covered. Roll the dough. You want to use only the smallest amount of flour possible to keep the dough from sticking. This takes practice. Cookie dough that is rolled fairly thin (1/8 inch thickness, but not less), doesn’t spread much when rolled this thin and is ideal for intricate cut-out cookies.4. Cover a baking sheet with Silpat or parchment sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Cut the cookies with a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter and place on the baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until edges just begin to color.5.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse to combine. Add shortening and butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 4 tablespoons of water and pulse to combine. Add more water as needed, until the dough comes together when pressed. It should not be overly moist. Dump the dough onto plastic, wrap it up, forming it into a disc. Refrigerate it for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.After the dough has chilled, divide it into 2 equal pieces.  On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the crust so it is large enough to fir your pie pan.  Press it into the pan.  Roll the other half so it is large enough to cover the pie after being filled.  Fold that half gently into quarters and place inside the pie pan.  Put the pan with both crusts back in the refrigerator while you make the filling.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Make the filling.  In a large bowl, combine rhubarb, sugar, cornstarch, and orange juice and zest.  Stir until all of the ingredients are well combined.Spoon the rhubarb into the pie shell.  Try not to get too much of the juice.  Scatter the butter over the top and spoon one spoonful of juice over the top if there is a lot left.  DO NOT add all of the juice or your pie will be soupy.  Place the top half of the crust over the fruit and press the top and bottom crust together firmly, creating a seal.  Flute the edges if you would like.  Brush with milk and sprinkle with demerara sugar.  Bake for 15 minutes on a foil lined baking sheet to catch any bubbling juices.  Without opening the oven, reduce the temperature to 375 and continue baking for about 1 hour more, rotating halfway through if necessary, until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling vigorously.  Cool completely in pan.  Pie may be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen in pieces, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in a zipper bag.  Thaw in a 350 degree F oven for about 30 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the crust. In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, and salt.

A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. One wine you could try is NV Solera Cream Sherry. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 17 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Prepare 15 standard cupcake liners on a lined baking sheet and set aside.                    Melt the chocolate in a microwave and stir until smooth.  Set aside to let cool slightly.                    Place the butter, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment.                    Beat on low to medium speed until light and fluffy.                      Add the eggs and beat on low speed until incorporated.                    Sift together the plain flour and baking powder.  Add half of the flour mixture to the egg and butter mixture and mix until smooth.                      Add the milk to the batter, while mixing, and finally the remaining flour mixture.  Mix until smooth.                    Finally, fold through the melted chocolate, making sure the batter is well mixed and no streaks remain.                    Divide the mixture between the cupcake liners.  Bake at 175 for 20 minutes or until risen and cooked through.  Make sure not to over bake the cupcakes.                    Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.                    Half fill a large piping bag with the Salted Vanilla Caramel Buttercream.  Use whatever decorative or plain tip you prefer.  Pipe swirls of buttercream on each cupcake.                    Finish with a drizzle of extra Salted Vanilla Caramel Sauce.                    Once frosted, the cupcakes will keep fresh for a several days, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.                    Place the egg whites and cream of tartar into the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk until frothy. Add the first amount of caster sugar in a steady stream while still whisking. Continue to whisk at medium speed while you prepare the sugar syrup.                    Place the water into a stainless steel or copper saucepan. Add the second amount of caster sugar in the centre. Place over a low to medium heat to dissolve the sugar. Do not stir the syrup as it cooks. Raise the heat and cook the syrup until it reaches 130.                    By this stage, the egg whites should have reached a soft peak stage. As you continue to whisk, add the hot syrup in a steady stream, down the sides of the meringue. Avoid pouring directly down the side of the bowl or on to the whisk. Keep whisking until the meringue reaches stiff peaks and is cooled completely.                    Make sure the butter is at room temperature and soft and pliable, or else the buttercream will be lumpy. By the same token, make sure your meringue has cooled so that it won't melt the butter, making the buttercream runny.                    Replace the whisk attachment with the paddle attachment.                    Add the butter one-third at a time, beating well after each addition until the cubes of butter have been fully incorporated into the meringue. The mixture will appear to separate a little but just keep whisking and it will become smooth and light and fluffy.                    Add the Salted Vanilla Caramel Sauce and beat until incorporated.                    The buttercream is now ready to pipe.                    If making ahead of time, store covered and airtight in the refrigerator for several days.                    This buttercream can also be frozen for up to a month before defrosting, beating and using.                    Place the sugar into a stainless steel saucepan.  I prefer stainless steel as this allows me to see the colour of the caramel as it cooks.                    In a separate saucepan, place the cream and heat gently until it reaches boiling point.  Switch off the heat.                     Place the pan over a low heat and gently stir the sugar as it dissolves.  The best action is to gently move the sugar toward the middle of the pan and back, checking the edges of the pan for any sugar that is dissolving and colouring too quickly and mix it in.    Dont take your eyes off it for a second and have patience.  When it is all dissolved, stop stirring and let it cook until the colour deepens.  You can gently swirl the caramel on the base of the pan to make sure the caramel darkens evenly.  Cook the sugar until the caramel is a lovely deep amber colour.                    When ready, carefully pour in the warmed cream, stirring as you go.  Keep stirring over a low heat until the mixture is smooth.  Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and salt (to taste), and stir in the butter in two batches.  Stir until the caramel is smooth and silky.  Pour the caramel into a bowl or jar, and set it aside to cool before using.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 17","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Prepare 15 standard cupcake liners on a lined baking sheet and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404676,"name":"muffin liners","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/muffin-or-cupcake-forms.png"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/equipment_100x100/baking-sheet.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Melt the chocolate in a microwave and stir until smooth.
